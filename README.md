### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

When I first saw this challenge it intimidated me a lot, so I avoided it for a while until I could not anymore. I managed to breeze through the first part with relative ease until I got to the mobile view, it seemed easy but it still stumped me. So again, I procrastinated until finally, I finished it in like...2 hours. I'm proud of myself regardless.

I don't know how to incorporate the JavaScript file! So I did without it.


```html
<p><span class="pline1">You scored higher than 65% of <br> the</span> <span class="pline2">people who have taken <br>these tests.</span></p>
```
Seems inconsequential but for the longest time, I did'nt know how to make the lines break for the desktop view and mobile view seperately.

I'm proud of all the css!


### Continued development

I definitely want to be more consistent and dedicated to learning JavaScript.
